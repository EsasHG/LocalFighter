Bugs:
- can glide through walls
- player collision with each other doesnt work.
- when aiming diagonally with my keyboard, movement is limited. 
  Only happens with my one keyboard, doesnt seem to be code related
SOLVED bugs:
- bullets dont always spawn because of collisions
- can shoot yourself forward by colliding with own bullets.
